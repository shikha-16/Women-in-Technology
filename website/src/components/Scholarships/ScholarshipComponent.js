                At Google, we believe a diversity of attributes, experiences,
                and perspectives are needed to build tools that can change the
                world. Everyone deserves an opportunity to pursue connections in
                the industry, networking with peers, and a career path in
                technology. To help break down the barriers that prevent
                underrepresented groups in technology and business from
                attending leading conferences, we're excited to offer Google
                Conference and Travel Scholarships for selected conferences in
                the tech industry and related fields.
