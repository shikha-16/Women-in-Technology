### 2. Systems Theory

  * **Computer Architecture and engineering**: Principles behind organizing and building a computer
  
    Description: Computer architecture is a specification describing how hardware and software technologies interact to create a computer platform or system. When we think of the word architecture, we think of building a house or a building. Keeping that same principle in mind, computer architecture involves building a computer and all that goes into a computer system.

  * **Computer Networks**: Study of organizing computers into networks and communication within a network and between networks.
  
    Description: A computer network is a group of computers that use a set of common communication protocols over digital interconnections for the purpose of sharing resources located on or provided by the network nodes. The interconnections between nodes are formed from a broad spectrum of telecommunication network technologies, based on physically wired, optical, and wireless radio-frequency methods that may be arranged in a variety of network topologies.
